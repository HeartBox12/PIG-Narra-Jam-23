PC (Placeholder): Hi, Leigh, can I-
Leigh_Actor3 (Placeholder): What is't, knave??
[wait time="1.5"]
PC: I'm just gonna...[pause] give you a second.
[wait time="1.5"]
Leigh_Actor3: Aye, sorry about yond. I has't to get out of character.
PC: It's okay, take your time.
[wait time="2.0"]
Leigh_Actor3: Metaverse, gaslight, selfie, mansplain.
Leigh_Actor3: Okay, I'm back. Hi!
PC: Hello! Sorry, I know I shouldn't pull you out of the zone.
Leigh_Actor3: I have to use Chekhov's techniques for this show.[pause] Because, like,[pause] I don't have that much experience as a 19th century land baron.
PC: That's a shame, you're missing out.
Leigh_Actor3: But Caroline has us acting so dramatically that it's kind of a whole thing to get in and out of that mindspace.
PC: Hence the piratey talk.
Leigh_Actor3: I mean, there are no pirates in the play.[pause] But I can't promise that Davy Jones and LeChuck aren't influencing my villain improv.
PC: You're not as bad as the time you played the school bully.
Leigh_Actor3: You can blame Strasberg for that. I tried to identify personally with that character. Ended up just being a dick to everyone for three weeks.
PC: You went full Jared Leto.
Leigh_Actor3: I went full Jared Leto. I locked Hana in the lighting box once because she was a nerd.
PC: We should cast you as a nice person for once. You might bring us all ice cream.
Leigh_Actor3: How's your drama study going? It's been a while since you asked to run a repetition exercise with me.
PC: Um, I guess I was pretty disheartened that I didn't land a role in this show.[pause] So I'm taking a break.
Leigh_Actor3: Oh, that sucks.[pause] Well, you know, there are companies other than Doomsday. You can audition with them too.
PC: Well, yeah.[pause] But I knew you all already so it felt way less scary.
Leigh_Actor3: I get that. Auditions are hard.
PC: I guess I don't really have an option now. I have to look at other companies.
Leigh_Actor3: Crosswalk Productions operates out of Centaur Theatre downtown. They do big casts so you can get in as an extra pretty easily.
Leigh_Actor3: Wooden Spoon Theatre is a little collective just down the road. They're really nice people if you can break in, but also great actors, so it's tough competition for roles.
PC: Thanks, Leigh. I'll look them up.
Leigh_Actor3: And we're auditioning for Waiting for Godot very soon. There are five parts, so even with Eduardo guaranteed to get one, you have a decent chance of being the slave or the boy.
PC: I don't think I'll be setting foot in this theatre for...[pause] quite a long time.
[wait]
Leigh_Actor3: Maybe that's for the best.
Leigh_Actor3: Look, it's been lovely to talk to you and I wish you success with all my heart,[pause] but I really need to start channelling a nasty old English guy again.
PC: Absolutely! Break a leg.
Leigh_Actor3: Forsooth, I shall. And haply thine!
